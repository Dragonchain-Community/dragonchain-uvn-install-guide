## Automatic Installation Guide

1. Make sure you have the required information gathered
    - Your Chain ID and Matchmaking Token from the Dragonchain Console
      - See the lesson on General Preparation to learn how to register your chain if you haven't    
    - The “endpoint URL” for your installation:
      - This will either be a domain name (http://example.com) or
      - Your server’s public IP address (http://12.34.56.78)
        - If following the Linode tutorial, your endpoint will be http://yourserveripaddress
    - The port number to use on your server
      - Unless you KNOW you need a different port, just use 30000 here
  
2. Connect to your VPS or VM using Git Bash or your terminal
    - If following the Linode tutorial, copy and paste the "ssh root@..." command you saved from the Networking tab
    
3. Follow the instructions in the dedicated repository for the installer here to be sure you're using the latest version:
