# General Preparation for Launching a Dragonchain Unmanaged Verification Node

## Get Registered on Dragon Net

1. Login to the Dragonchain console website (https://console.dragonchain.com/)
2. Click the Dragon Net tab on the left
3. Click "Register Unmanaged Chain"
4. Give your chain a name and click "Create Unmanaged L2 Chain"
5. Click the Matchmaking tab at the top to retrieve your Chain ID and Matchmaking Token 

## Recommended VPS/VM Server Specifications
- 2 CPUs (or Cores)
- 4GB RAM SHOULD work fine, but 8GB is recommended if you can swing it
  - It will DEFINITELY lower to 4GB recommended on the next Dragonchain release
  - You may run into performance issues and even have trouble with install on 4GB VMs
- 16GB Disk Space

## Security Considerations
It is absolutely possible to run a Dragonchain node on a virtual machine or dedicated PC on your home or office network. 

**Be aware that you WILL have to expose your PC and network to the outside internet if you choose this route.**

I cannot provide security recommendations for ensuring you've safely setup your network and server. 

For this reason, I **highly** recommend you use a service like Linode or Amazon Web Services to host your Dragonchain node!
